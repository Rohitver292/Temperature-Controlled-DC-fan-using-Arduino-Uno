# Temperature-Controlled-DC-fan-using-Arduino-Uno
In this arduino based project, we are going to build a temperature-controlled fan using Arduino. With this circuit, we will be able to adjust the fan speed in our home or office according to the room temperature and also show the temperature and fan speed changes on a 16x2 LCD display.
**Components using:-**
1.Arduino uno
2.LM35
3.LCD 16x2
4.DC Motor With Blade
